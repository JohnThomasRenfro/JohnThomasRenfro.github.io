POLICE HQ: USE ILLUSTRATION #30. There will be 1 ·3 police robots
in the first room of this complex. They will inquire what the nature of
business of any entrant is, and the language will be totally
unintelligible without some scientific or magical means of
understanding, although the robots con translate the characters'
speech in 1 turn. The robots will then apprehend (see section on
police robots at the end of the module) the characters and place
them in the security cells (six 1 O' x 1 O' rooms to the north) - as few
per cell as possible - for detention and questioning by a "proper
authority" unless the party hos a red, gray or orange card to show.
Of course, there are no "proper authorities" anymore, and
prisoners will starve to death, as the computer controlled feeding
devices in the area turn out drinkable liquids but indigestible
food. The cell locks (located in the doors) operate by any of the
cards mentioned (gray, red, or orange). The cells have walls on
three sides while across the front there is a row of short projecting
studs on both the top and the bottom. In the centerof this "wall" is
a small post with a card lock similar to those found on other
doors. Below this is a button and a dial that control the force
screen. When a cell is in use, the force screen will be turned on
and on invisible wall will radiate in the area between the studs. The
cells are force field shells, so magic will not function beyond them,
but cold hos a 1 0% chance of causing a lock to malfunction, fire
balls (from outside and distant, hopefully . . . ) and magic
missiles have a 50% chance, and lightning/electricHy a 1 0%
chance per die of dmg. The robots will not toke away any
gear from prisoners unless the item was used to atk one oftheir
number or is a wpn they are familiar with (pistols, etc.).
At various times robots will leave, so at some point within 1 2 turns
there will be only 1 robot there, but there is a 1 in 1 2 chance of
another entering each turn.
A locked metal chest in the corner farthest from the cells contains
2 gas masks (give total immunity to all gasses on the ship), 1 2
s leep gas grenades, a n d 2 needler pistols with 1 c l i p of
ammunition for each. (Weapons are detailed at the end of the
module.) The chest can be forced open with magical wpns
- one in six chance per wpn per round of forcing. It will also
open by gray or red cord placement in its lock slot.
The first police robot disabled/destroyed here by the party will
have a red card stored in its chest compartment, but itwill haveto
be pried out carefully, so there is a 50% chance of destroying it,
lowered 1 0% for each point of dexterity above 1 4 of the character
making the attempt.

A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it.

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.

function Wish(){a="Wish,lvl9,1act,instant,self,Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice: You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300ft in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a dmg type you choose. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich s life drain atk. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent s successful save, a foe s critical hit, or a friend s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with @adv or @disadv, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item s current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic dmg per level of that spell. This dmg can t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",b="1d20+0",c="Buff Heal",dmgDice="1d8+0",getAction(t1)}
